## **Key Focus Areas:**  
This project will focus on analyzing key call centre metrics, including:  
- **Total number of calls answered and abandoned**  
- **Speed of answer and response time trends**  
- **Average call duration and efficiency**  
- **Customer satisfaction scores and feedback trends**  
- **Agent performance and workload distribution**  

---

### **1. Call Handling Performance**  
- **Total Calls:** 5000
- **Answered Calls:** 4054 (80% of total calls)  
- **Abandoned Calls:** 946 (19% abandonment rate)  
- **Resolved Calls:** 3,646 (91% of answered calls)  
ðŸ”¹ **Insight:** High call answer rate, but nearly 1 in 5 calls are abandoned, indicating potential staffing or efficiency issues.

---

### **2. Response Time & Call Duration**  
- **Average Response Time:** **1 minute 8 seconds**  
- **Average Call Duration:** **3 minutes 45 seconds**  

ðŸ”¹ **Insight:** While response time is relatively quick, optimizing it further could improve customer satisfaction.

---

### **3. Customer Satisfaction Trends**  
- **Overall Satisfaction Score:** **3.40/5**  
- **Breakdown:**  
  - **Excellent:** 40%  
  - **Neutral:** 24%  
  - **Poor:** 36%  

ðŸ”¹ **Insight:** Over **one-third of customers are dissatisfied** (Poor rating). The trend suggests a **gradual decline in satisfaction over months**, with an increase in "Poor" ratings.

---

### **4. Monthly Trends in Satisfaction**  
| Month | Excellent (%) | Neutral (%) | Poor (%) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **January** | 41.25% | 25.79% | 32.96% |
| **February** | 40.59% | 22.83% | 36.57% |
| **March** | 39.45% | 24.32% | 36.23% |

## **Recommendations for Improvement**
1. **Reduce Abandoned Calls:** Analyze peak call hours and allocate more agents during high-traffic periods.  
2. **Improve Customer Satisfaction:** Investigate why the **"Poor" rating is increasing**â€”possible causes include long wait times, unresolved issues, or poor agent communication.  
3. **Optimize Response Time:** Reducing the **1:08** response time may lead to fewer abandoned calls and better satisfaction.
