# **Project Overview: Call Centre Trends Dashboard**  

## **Project Name:**  
Call Centre Trends Analysis & Performance Insights  

## **Company Background:**  
PhoneNow is a leading telecommunications company that provides customer support services worldwide through its call centre operations. With thousands of customer interactions daily, PhoneNow aims to enhance customer experience, operational efficiency, and agent performance by leveraging data-driven insights.

## **Key Focus Areas:**  
This project will focus on analyzing key call centre metrics, including:  
- **Total number of calls answered and abandoned**  
- **Speed of answer and response time trends**  
- **Average call duration and efficiency**  
- **Customer satisfaction scores and feedback trends**  
- **Agent performance and workload distribution**  

## **Expected Outcomes:**  
- A **dynamic, interactive dashboard** providing real-time insights into call centre performance  
- **Data-driven recommendations** to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction  
- A **streamlined reporting system** for management to make informed decisions  

By transforming raw call centre data into actionable insights, this project will help PhoneNow enhance its customer service experience and drive business success.
